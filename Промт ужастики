Генератор зомби 

 * Main Scene (Theme): A close-up, hyper-realistic portrayal of a zombie's decaying face.
 * Character(s): A single, decaying zombie.
 * Appearance: Extreme detail on the face: pale, mottled, and desiccated skin with visible, intricate veins, deep crevices, and areas of exposed, putrid flesh. Sunken, milky-white eyes with ruptured blood vessels. A distorted, gaping mouth revealing rotted, broken teeth and a shriveled tongue. Patches of matted, sparse hair clinging to the scalp. Visible bone structure beneath the decaying tissue.
 * Emotion: Vacant, soulless stare, an expression of eternal torment and hunger, a silent scream of decay.
 * Clothing & Accessories: None visible, focus exclusively on the face.
 * Pose & Action: Static, direct gaze, slightly open mouth.
 * Environment: None, the background should be entirely out of focus or a simple, dark, nondescript void to emphasize the face.
 * Foreground: None, focus exclusively on the face.
 * Background: Deeply blurred, dark, indistinct background to ensure maximum focus on the face.
 * Lighting: Harsh, dramatic, and directional lighting from a single, unseen source, creating deep shadows and highlighting every gruesome detail of the decaying skin texture. Backlight to emphasize contours.
 * Effects (FX): Subtle, almost imperceptible wisps of putrid vapor or dust around the face, extreme textural detail, slight subsurface scattering on decaying tissue.
 * Composition & Camera:
   * Angle: Direct eye-level, confronting the viewer.
   * Framing: Extreme close-up, filling the frame with the zombie's face.
   * Lens: Macro lens, emphasizing intricate details.
   * Focus & DOF: Pin-sharp focus on the eyes and mouth, with an extremely shallow depth of field, blurring everything else.
 * Color Palette & Mood: Desaturated, sickly greens, browns, and greys, with strong contrasts of deep reds and purples in the decaying flesh; grotesque, horrifying, visceral, disturbing.
 * Style & Render:
   * Art Style: Ultrarealistic, photorealistic, cinematic horror, medical illustration level of detail.
   * Detail: Micro-detailed, hyper-textured, forensic quality.
   * Render Engines (for inspiration): Unreal Engine 5, Octane Render, Redshift, V-Ray.
