### ðŸ”¥ Prompt: Hyper-Realistic Demon Face (Close-Up)

* **Main Scene (Theme)**: A close-up, hyper-realistic portrayal of a demonic entity's corrupted face.
* **Character(s)**: A single, ancient demon â€” a monstrous, otherworldly being of infernal origin.
* **Appearance**:

  * Distorted, inhuman facial structure with cracked, obsidian-like skin interwoven with glowing, fiery veins.
  * Sharp, asymmetrical bone ridges emerging from the forehead and jaw.
  * Fiery, pupil-less eyes or glowing with ember-like intensity.
  * Mouth lined with needle-like teeth, unnaturally long tongue, dried blood and molten-like cracks around the lips.
  * Horns â€” twisted, jagged, asymmetrical, as if grown from tortured stone or scorched bone.
* **Emotion**: A gaze filled with ancient malice and cruel intelligence â€” silent rage simmering behind eyes of fire.
* **Clothing & Accessories**: None visible, full focus on the head and upper neck â€” maybe fragments of scorched armor fused with the flesh.
* **Pose & Action**: Static, direct confrontation with the viewer; the demonâ€™s face is partially shadowed, lips slightly parted in a sneer or whisper of a curse.
* **Environment**: Void-like, smoldering darkness; vague embers or rising smoke barely visible around the contours of the head.
* **Foreground**: None â€” maximum emphasis on the facial form.
* **Background**: Deep black with faint ambient hellfire flickers; fully blurred to enhance isolation of the subject.
* **Lighting**:

  * Harsh, low-angle red-orange lighting from beneath, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting facial deformations.
  * Subtle rim lighting on horn edges and facial ridges, giving the illusion of glowing heat.
* **Effects (FX)**:

  * Wisps of smoke rising from cracks in the skin.
  * Slight heat distortion and faint embers floating in the air.
  * Minor motion blur on flickering heat lines or smoke trails.
* **Composition & Camera**:

  * **Angle**: Direct frontal, slight tilt for unease.
  * **Framing**: Extreme close-up â€” face fills the entire frame.
  * **Lens**: Macro or 85mm-style lens to emphasize textural complexity and facial asymmetry.
  * **Focus & DOF**: Eyes and teeth in sharp detail; everything else falls into shallow blur.
* **Color Palette & Mood**:

  * Burnt reds, charred blacks, glowing oranges, hints of sulfurous yellow.
  * Mood: demonic, oppressive, ancient evil â€” deeply unsettling yet mesmerizing.
* **Style & Render**:

  * **Art Style**: Ultrarealistic, photorealistic horror-fantasy.
  * **Detail**: Micro-detailing â€” pores, cracks, scorched tissue, ash-like textures.
  * **Render Engines (for inspiration)**: Unreal Engine 5, Octane Render, Redshift, V-Ray â€” cinematic horror with a dark fantasy twist.
