    Write a complete, production-ready Python script for a Hugging Face Spaces app using Gradio.   

        Use the latest stable versions of Gradio and any required libraries (e.g., transformers, torch, PIL, etc.).  
        Ensure the code runs without errors on Hugging Face Spaces on the first launch.  
        Include proper error handling, type hints (optional but preferred), and clear docstrings.  
        Use a minimal and efficient structure—no unnecessary dependencies.  
        The app should load quickly and be suitable for a demo or portfolio project.  
        Prefer GPU acceleration if available, but fall back gracefully to CPU.  
        Follow Hugging Face Spaces best practices (e.g., avoid heavy startup operations unless cached).  
        Include a requirements.txt or specify dependencies inline if needed.  
        The interface should be clean, responsive, and user-friendly.  
        If using a model, load it only once (e.g., with @gradio.cache or module-level loading).
        Output the full code and, if relevant, the requirements.txt.
